Overview:
---------

ftpsync.pl synchronizes a local directory tree and a remote FTP directory tree.

Initially it was written to automate web publishing, but might be useful for
some other purposes, like mirroring not-too-large public sites, data
replication, and more.

Call "ftpsync.pl -h" to get a short parameter explanation.


Why use ftpsync.pl instead of mirror, sitecopy, ...?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes, there are similar projects, hence some comments on them:

Compared to mirror, ftpsync.pl is capable of PUTting, not only GETting stuff.
(Don't blame me if mirror is able to PUT, I couldn't find a way.)

Compared to sitecopy, if the remote site was changed by other tools and/or activites since the previous run of the synchronization tool, ftpsync.pl doesn't get a hard time. Unless network problems occur or bugs come into action, ftpsync.pl does a synchronizes reliably.

Compared to both tools, ftpsync.pl is very lightweight. ;-))


Requirements / Restrictions:
----------------------------

- Perl 5.6+
  ftpsync.pl was initially developed on Perl 5.6.0-81 on SuSE Linux 7.2,
  older Perl 5.x version might work. Test reports welcome at ftpsync@ibcl.at!

- File::Find, IO::Handle
  IMHO parts of the basic perl package.

- Net::FTP
  Part of the libnet-perl package.
  
- File::Listing
  Part of the libwww-perl package.
  
- UNIX like operating systems on local system
  Porting to DOS based systems should be easily done by changing the
  directory separator.
  
- Perhaps, the script does not work with all FTP servers.
  It is being tested only against UNIX based FTP servers.


Bug-Reports, contact:
---------------------

Besides ftpsync.sourceforge.net, ftpsync@ibcl.at is a good target for comments
of any kind.

-------------------------

FTPSync.pl is also eMail ware, which means that the initial author

- if anyone uses the script on production level,
- if anyone distributes or advertises it in any way,
- if anyone starts to (try to) improve it.
