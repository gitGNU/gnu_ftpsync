=> 1.00
=======

* 1.0 created 2001-10-20 23:10 by Christoph Lechleitner <lech@ibcl.at>

Quite good for a 5 hour hack, isn't it?
O.K., I have already written similar programs for local file systems
in Pascal for DOS, Win3x and OS/2, and in VisualBasic for Win95b.


1.00 => 1.10
============

 * config file support
   This is mportant to avoid putting ftp passwords in the process list!

 * much more informative standard and verbose/debug output, including kind
   of a advance information
   
 * better FTP-URL parsing supporting such without user/password
 
 * much better default values, e.g. ftp://ftp:anonymous@localhost/., ...
 
 * softlinks are now detected (locally and remote) and treated somewhat
   correctly, i.e. they are ignored correctly ;-))
 

1.10 => 1.x
===========

None so far ;-))

See TODO file for plans.
