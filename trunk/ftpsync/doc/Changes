1.11 => 1.20
============

 * generally, most foreseeable problems are beeing checked, in particular:

   - unability to connect to FTP server
   - unability to login into FTP server
   - unability to change to local or remote base directory
   - unability to change to remote subdirectory
   - unability to create local or remote subdirectory
   - unability to remove local or remote subdirectory
   - unability to put or get a file within 3 trials
   
   All these errors (except the last one) leads to immediate abortion.


1.10 => 1.11
============

 * Some optical corrections concerning output
 
 * Files are now automatically re-transferred until the size on both ends 
   matches

 * -? now corrrectly recognized 


1.00 => 1.10
============

 * config file support
   This is mportant to avoid putting ftp passwords in the process list!

 * much more informative standard and verbose/debug output, including kind
   of a advance information
   
 * better FTP-URL parsing supporting such without user/password
 
 * much better default values, e.g. ftp://ftp:anonymous@localhost/., ...
 
 * softlinks are now detected (locally and remote) and treated somewhat
   correctly, i.e. they are ignored correctly ;-))

Quite good for a 5 hour hack, isn't it?
O.K., I have already written similar programs for local file systems
in Pascal for DOS, Win3x and OS/2, and in VisualBasic for Win95b.
